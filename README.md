# acoustic_model
🧠 Project Overview
This project implements a complete speech recognition pipeline that handles everything from noise reduction and feature extraction to acoustic modeling using HMMs and deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust and accurate system that can operate effectively in noisy environments and provide real-time or near real-time transcription capabilities.

🚀 Key Features
Noise Reduction using techniques like spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering

Feature Extraction including MFCCs, pitch, and energy

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to segment speech from non-speech

Acoustic Modeling using:

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

Deep learning models (CNN/RNN)

Evaluation using WER, Accuracy, SNR, etc.

Visualization of spectrograms, waveforms, and model performance

Power BI Integration for dashboard-based insights
